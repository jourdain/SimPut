<p><b><i>strong_threshold</i></b> - Specify the strength threshold for Hypre/BoomerAMG, <b>strong_threshold</b> (float, default=0.85). Only effective if <b>type</b>=AMG and <b>amgpc</b>=HYPRE and <b>hypre_type</b>=BOOMERAMG. For 2D Laplace operators 0.25 is a good value, for 3D Laplace operators 0.5 or 0.6 is a better value. For elasticity problems, a large strength threshold, such as 0.9, is often better.
