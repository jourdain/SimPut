<p><b><i>hypre_coarsen</i></b> - Specifies the parallel coarsening algorithm for Hypre/BoomerAMG, <b>hypre_coarsen</b> (string, default=FALGOUT). Only effective if <b>type</b>=AMG and <b>amgpc</b>=HYPRE and <b>hypre_type</b>=BOOMERAMG. Values can be one of the following:
                             <ul>
                                 <li><b>CLJP</b> - Cleary-Luby-Jones-Plassman (a parallel coarsening algorithm using independent sets),
                                 <li><b>RUGE_STEUBEN</b> - Classical Ruge-Steuben on each processor, no boundary treatment (not recommended!),
                                 <li><b>MODIFIED_RUGE_STEUBEN</b> - Classical Ruge-Steuben on each processor, followed by a third pass, which add coarse points on the boundaries,
                                 <li><b>FALGOUT</b> - Falgout coarsening (uses RUGE_STEUBEN first, followed by CLJP using the interior coarse points generated by RUGE_STEUBEN as its first independent set),
                                 <li><b>PMIS</b> - PMIS-coarsening (a parallel coarsening algorithm using independent sets, generating lower complexities than CLJP, might also lead to slower convergence), or
                                 <li><b>HMIS</b> - HMIS-coarsening (uses one pass RUGE_STEUBEN on each processor independently, followed by PMIS using the interior C-points generated as its first independent set).
                             </ul>
