<h2>Energy</h2>

	The specification of the form of the energy equation.

    <p><b><i>form</i></b> - The form of the energy equation (string, default=isothermal). The <b>form</b> must be one of the following:
                             <ul>
                                 <li><b>Isothermal</b> - No energy equation is solved - the flow is isothermal,
                                 <li><b>Temperature</b> - The energy equation is solved in terms of temperature,
                                 <li><b>Enthalpy</b> - The energy equation is solved in terms of specific enthalpy, or
                                 <li><b>Internal Energy</b> - The energy equation is solved in terms of internal energy.
                             </ul>
